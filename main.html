	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a core concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of its input [1]. It is often expressed using "Big O" notation, which provides a useful approximation of an algorithm's efficient. </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory (or "space") that a computer program or algorithm requires to solve a problem O(n) . It is a fundamental concept in computer science used to analyze an algorithm's efficiency in terms of memory usage, complementing time complexity, which measures execution time</p>
